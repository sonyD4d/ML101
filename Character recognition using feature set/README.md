# Algorithm
   - Read the dataset which is hardcoded in csv file using pandas
   - Define a function which will calculate Euclidean distance for unknown/new character by using below formula
        dist(new,compare)=√(∑(new[i]-compare[i])^2 )
   - For new character calculate the Euclidean distance for each character present in dataset and output the one which has least distance.
   - Post processing: modify feature set to improve accuracy of model, removal of diagonal and addition of number of closed regions in our case.
